A coin sorter and wrapper calculator, implemented in JavaScript, automates the process of counting and sorting coins, and calculates the number of wrappers needed for each denomination. The calculator takes an input of unsorted coins, separates them by denomination (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, etc.), counts the number of coins in each category, and determines how many coin wrappers are needed based on standard wrapper capacities. Finally, it displays the count for each denomination and the required number of wrappers. This functionality can be achieved using JavaScript's conditional statements, loops, and data structures to manage and manipulate coin data.
